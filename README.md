# Data Transformation 🚕

The original data files are in CSV format and are stored in the "original data" folder. The following files are used:
uber-raw-data-apr14.csv
uber-raw-data-aug14.csv
uber-raw-data-jul14.csv
uber-raw-data-jun14.csv
uber-raw-data-may14.csv
uber-raw-data-sep14.csv
The code reads in each file using read.csv() and combines them into a single data frame using rbind().
Packages

The code performs the following analyses:
Groups the data by month and week and counts the number of trips in each group
Groups the data by hour of the day and counts the number of trips in each group
Groups the data by hour of the day and month of the year, and counts the number of trips in each group
Groups the data by day of the month and month of the year, and counts the number of trips in each group
Groups the data by day of the week and month of the year, and counts the number of trips in each group
Groups the data by Uber base code and month of the year, and counts the number of trips in each group
Creates a data frame of number of trips by day and hour of the day
Creates a data frame of number of trips by base and day of the week
Creates a data frame of number of trips by latitude and longitude
The code writes the resulting data frames to CSV files in the same directory as the R code.
Output
CSV files are generated by the code:
trips_by_hour.csv
trips_by_hour_month.csv
trips_by_full_month.csv
trips_by_day_month.csv
trips_by_base_month.csv
trips_by_hour_day.csv
trips_by_base_day.csv
trips_by_month_week.csv
trips_by_lat_lon.csv

# Maps and Predictive Model 🗺️ ✍️
The following maps have been created:
A graph that displays the number of trips for each hour, covering the time frame of hour 0 to 23. This map uses the geom_col() function.
A chart that displays the number of trips per hour per month. Each month is represented by a different color for ease of differentiation.

A graph that displays the total number of trips for each hour, aggregated across all months. This map does not include the months.
A chart that illustrates the number of trips by day and month. Thursdays and Fridays are the busiest days overall.

Six graphs that depict the number of trips taken each day in comparison to each month.
A table that presents the number of trips by days and months. This table can be filtered to display days, trips, or months in a specific order.
A visualization to compare the number of trips with their corresponding bases. The graph features five columns representing each month and shows the number of trips associated with each specific base.
A heatmap that displays the number of trips per hour by day. The highest heatmap values are for the later hours. However, the beginning and end of the heatmap appear to be reversed.
A heatmap that displays the number of trips taken per day across different months. Compared to the heatmap showing trips per hour by day, this heatmap exhibits more scattered data points.

A heatmap that displays the number of trips taken per day across different months. Compared to the heatmap showing trips per hour by day, this heatmap exhibits more scattered data points.
A map that shows 2000 of the latitude and longitude coordinates. All of the points are on the east side of the US.

#Predictions 📉

The predictive model uses the Uber dataset to predict the number of trips for a given date and time. The model uses the following libraries:
dplyr
lubridate
ggplot2
tidyr
caret
The caret library is used to create the model using the train() function. The dataset is split into training and testing data, and the randomForest() function is used to create the predictive model.
To use the predictive model, simply enter the date and time you want to predict the number of trips for, and the model will return an estimate of the number of trips.

To use this code, you can download or clone the repository and run the R code. The required packages can be installed using the install.packages() function. You will need to ensure that the original data files are stored in the "original data" folder, or modify the file paths in the code accordingly.
